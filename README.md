# Analytics-Design-to-Recommend-Yogurt-Flavors-to-Launch
Conducting analytics to provide input or recommendations to the decision of which flavors to launch next.
The project has four measurement goals:

1) Describe the percentage of sales of existing flavors in the Greek yogurt category (all brands)

2) Describe the percentage of sales of existing yogurt flavors outside of Greek yogurt (regular class of yogurt)

3) Describe survey respondentsâ€™ preferences for Greek yogurt flavors

4) Predict the best set of next flavors to add to achieve the highest reach using the survey data.
